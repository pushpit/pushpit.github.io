            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            As part of this visualization project, I am analyzing the Gender Inequality across the world and comparing
            some other aspects related to income and education levels. The question I am trying to answer is whether the
            education level, GDP, income level has any impact on the gender inequalities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Gender Inequality Index:  I have downloaded the data from <a href = "http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/gender-inequality-index-gii">here</a> in the csv format. Each row in the csv represents a country and its GII values for different years.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gross National Income per capita PPP (current US$) : I have downloaded the data from
                <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/378834-how-does-the-world-bank-classify-countries">here</a>
                The countries are classified into 4 different income buckets (low, high, lower-middle, upper-middle).
            </li>
            <li>
                Education Index : I have downloaded the data from <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/103706">here</a>.
                The countries are classified into 4 different education level (as indicated by their education index) buckets (low, high, lower-medium, upper-medium).
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Converted some of the files to vertical list format i.e. in some of the data files all the data for each country is specified in a single row, which is not easy to join, so I pivoted those data files on the year columns. I have used python  (Pandas) to create dataframes and pivot the data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cleaned up some country name formatting differences (as in one file the country names are specified using camel casing). For this also, I used custom python script.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have joined data representing various measures like GNI (Gross National Income) per capita with GII (Gender Inequality Index) data based on country and year and prepared the final sets which are used to build the charts.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

                            Gender Inequality Index (GII) aggregated(median) across different parameters:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Income Bucket: Based on GDP per capita USD (PPP)</b> : Countries are grouped
                                    into four buckets Low(L), Low-Middle(LM), Upper-Middle(UM), High(H) based on their
                                    per capita GDP USD (PPP). This grouping level is selected by default. This grouping
                                    gives us a view of how GII varies over the period of time for countries in different income
                                    buckets. After seeing the chart it is quite evident that the countries in lower income
                                    bucket have higher gender inequality. User can drill down to details of the countries
                                    in a particular bucket by clicking on the line for that bucket.
                                </li>

                                    <b>Regions of the world</b>: Countries are grouped into different regions they belonged to.
                                    User can select this grouping level by selecting this option from the grouping
                                    drop-down. This grouping gives us a view of how GII varies over the period of time for
                                    countries in different regions. User can drill down to details of the countries in a
                                    particular bucket by clicking on the line for that bucket.

                                    <b>Education index</b>: Countries are grouped into 4 different buckets based on their
                                    <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/103706">Education Index</a>. User can select
                                    this grouping from the grouping drop-down. After seeing the chart it is evident that
                                    countries with higher level of education tends to have lower GII. User can drill down to
                                    details of the countries in a particular bucket by clicking on the line for that bucket.

                                    <b>Country</b>: This is the detailed country level view presented in the grouping chart
                                    for creating a martini glass structure, where users can look at some of the grouped data
                                    and then can dive into the details. Main theme I want to keep here for just the grouping chart
                                    (see detailed chart description below), is to give users ability to explore data without drill
                                    downs to detailed chart. By default only a few countries are selected, so that users are not
                                    overwhelmed with the data, but a multi-select country box is presented to user, so that they can
                                    select all the countries they want to (for better experience select a maximum of 10 countries).
                                    There are no drill downs for this view as it is already at a granular country level.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Detailed Charts:</b> Three of the grouping charts (IncomeBucket, EducationIndexBucket & Region)
                                    have provided user the ability to drill down to country level details. On clicking any of the line
                                    in the grouping chart user can drill down to the detailed chart. All the countries belonging to the group
                                    selected are displayed in the detailed chart. Detailed chart is provided with color coding option, so that
                                    user can drill down in a particular bucket and color code the countries within that bucket based on other
                                    grouping types. This provides a strong feature for e.g. if user drill down on high income bucket and then
                                    color code the detailed graph with education index, user can answer some interesting question like Kuwait/Oman
                                    though high income countries have lower education index which might be contributing to that fact that they have relatively
                                    high GII compare to their peers in the income bucket. The color legends in the detailed charts can be used to filter data.

                            and then provide a scene to explore data in details. User can switch between different scenes based on the
                            grouping type that can be selected from drop-down. Also, the detailed country scene in this chart group kept at the
                            end of the list, which provide a nice flow from overview & grouped information to more detailed exploration of
                            the data.

                            The detailed chart drill down provide scenes based on the color code. Users can select different color code,
                            to change the view & color scheme of the chart. The flow of color code is kept same as in the
                            grouping level charts, in order to be consistent. Also, color legends or country multi-select box
                            filters provide streamline ways to switch between different scene. For e.g. a user can select
                            a legend filter, a new scene (view) is displayed and if then user select different countries from
                            the multi-select box, there is a nice flow to reset the legend filter and apply the country filter.
                            Similarly, there is a streamline flow among different color coding schemes.

                            GII for a given scene.

                            <b>Tooltip:</b> In page 1, both the grouped level chart as well as the detailed level chart provide tooltips
                            to the user. In page 2 also, users are provided with tooltips through out the scatter plot. Tooltips are
                            provided as mouse over action on the chart components like line, scatter plot circl, legend rectangles etc.

                            I have added the functionality to change the pointer to hand when mouse hovers on click-able data point.
                            This provides the user information regarding the visualization and drill-down/filter opportunity.

                            The axis labels are also an important annotation item here. User can notice in Page 1 grouping chart,
                            that Y-axis label change from "Median GII" to "GII" when user goes from
                            IncomeBucket, EducationIndexBucket & Region group to country and vice-versa.

                            Page 1 use grouping level parameter(grouping drop-down) to generate line chart for various grouping level. Also, in country level
                            grouping scene, "country multi-select" is used to provide parameters for filtering the data and
                            changing the line chart.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In page 1 detailed level chart, color code parameter (color code drop-down) is used to color
                            code the line chart. Also, "country multi-select" is used to provide parameters for filtering the data.
                            Legends are also used as parameters to filter the data and change the line chart.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Page 2 use year (year slider at the top) as parameter to generate the scatter plot for that particular year.
                            In addition to that color code drop down provide parameter to change color scheme of the scatter plot
                            and generate appropriate legends. Legends also provide params for filtering the data.
                        </li>

                    <b>Trigger Utilization</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Page 1 use grouping level parameter(grouping drop-down) to generate line chart for various grouping level. Label is put next to group
                            type drop-down for directing users to use that trigger. Every time a new grouping level is selected the
                            data in the chart changes, as well as the legends also change.
                            When user select country level grouping, they are provided with the country multi select from which they
                            can select the country(s) to trigger a new scene with line charts for the countries that are selected. In <b>IncomeBucket,
                            EducationIndexBucket & Region</b> grouping charts user can trigger the generation of detailed chart by clicking on
                            each group line. I have made the pointer to change to hand shape when user hover over the line, so that
                            they can see there is a clickable functionality.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In Page 1 detailed chart, triggers are added to change the chart and legends when user select different color codes from the drop-down.
                            The triggers to change chart are also there for country and legend filters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Page 2 has triggers based on the year slider. The scatter plot is changed based on the year selected and clears
                            out any filters. There is a
                            trigger based on the color code selection to change the colors in scatter plot as well as change the legend.
                            The trigger to change chart is also there for legend filters. There is a trigger to change the axes domain
                            based on the legend filter selected, as based on the legend filter, the data set is filtered and
                            domains are recalculated for both the axes. I have made the pointer to change to hand shape wherever a trigger
                            is available on the scene.

                            Heading for detailed chart in Page 1 is displayed based on the bucket selected from the grouping chart.
                            As new bucket is clicked in the grouping chart, the heading is cleared and new appropriate heading is generated.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Year selected from the year slider is also shown to the user and change as user move the slider
                            back-forth.

                            When selecting a legend filter, the rectangle for that filter grows in size a little bit to
                            notify user of his/her selection. If the user select another legend filter the previous selection clears off
                            and its legend rectangle goes back to original size. If the user clicked on an already selected legend rectangle
                            than also it goes back to original size and clear filter.

                            In page 1, in all the line charts the width of the lines increases on mouseover, this
                            provide users help to consume the information depicted in the chart.

                    Overall each of the page designed as part of this project, provides sufficient overview and help
                    user quickly see the affects of different factors on Gender Inequality. I have followed the principles of
                    narrative visualization and effectively use scenes to depict different data views. Also, I have tooltips and
                    other annotation all through out the charts. I have effectively used parameters to trigger the changes in the charts
                    as well as related elements on the page. I have provided different filtering mechanism, so that users can filter data esp.
                    in charts which are showing lots of information (like GII for all the countries).
